    <div id="batcowl" class="text-box v-hidden">
      <div class="text-cover"></div>
      <h5>[ BAT COWL ]</h5>
      <p>The cowl's basic design has remained unchanged; however, it has been frequently updated to advance Batman's crusade. The
        one aspect of the cowl that does undergo variations is the ears, although the length and pointiness of the ears is supposedly
        primarily due to the style of the artist drawing Batman, and tends not to be tied to the functionality of the cowl in any way.
        However artist Karl Kerchl has drawn Batman's costume vault showing that he has a wide selection of cowls with ears of
        different lengths (Adventures of Superman #643).</p>
      <p>In addition to concealing his features and contributing to his imposing appearance, Batman's cowl has sometimes served other
        purposes. Occasionally, the cowl is depicted as having defense mechanisms such as electric shock or stun gas in order to
        prevent unauthorized removal.</p>
      <p>The cowl contains shifting lenses that identifies suspect's identities, as well as their weak points (through medical records),
        while simultaneously avoiding the possibility of eye identification. The lenses have special visions, like infrared vision
        (heat sensors), night vision, and ultraviolet vision.</p>
      <p>In addition, because some meta-human criminals have the power to see through solid objects, Batman lines the cowl with lead
        to protect his identity. One of the cowl's ears carries a high-gain antenna for an internal comm-link on the left side of the
        cowl, allowing Batman to stay in contact with his allies. The comm-link can also scan police radios and other communication
        frequencies. It also carries an inertial navigation unit to keep him in balance when facing foes such as the Scarecrow or Count Vertigo.</p>
      <p>The cowl's Kevlar panels provide a level of protection for his head against firearms. The front of the skull and the sides of the
        temples also have small armor inserts to increase the effectiveness of skull strikes and protect from concussive blows. Repeated
        encounters with the Mad Hatter also forced Batman to shield his cowl against the villain's mind control.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="batsuit" class="text-box v-hidden">
      <div class="text-cover"></div>
      <h5>[ BAT SUIT ]</h5>
      <p>The basic foundation of the Batsuit is a tight-fitting bodysuit, similar to many superheroes. In early depictions, it was
        similar to the garb of early 20th century circus performers. Batman #1 revealed that there is a ballistic vest sewn into the
        costume. In modern depictions, the briefs are integrated into the main costume, so that section of the costume constitutes only
        a seam and color change from the rest of the suit. The bodysuit has varied in color and style as depicted by different artists.</p>
      <p>The Post-Crisis version of the bodysuit is not constructed from simple fabric, but from Kevlar thread and carbon nanotube fibers.
        This imparts it with a unique sheen and makes it heavily resistant to tearing. In addition, the suit also is constructed with a
        full body electric shock delivery system, which is also layered into the suit's fabric. The basic version of the Batsuit is
        insulated against electricity and is mildly fire resistant. Batman utilizes many different body armor designs, some of which are
        constructed into his Batsuits, and others which are separate. In its most basic version, the suit is bulletproof around the upper
        torso and back and can withstand a point blank range blast from a 12-gauge shotgun. Other versions are entirely bullet proof to small
        arms fire, and have advanced flexible armor plating made from Carbon composites and lightweight metal polymers.</p>
      <h5>[ ARMOR ]</h5>
      <p>The Batsuit has been repeatedly updated in order to reflect advances in technology. Originally the costume contained no protective
        armor, since the creative talent felt that it made Batman seem too powerful to see him shrug off bullet hits. However, the real
        world advent of various forms of personal protective materials like Kevlar and the realization that being shot while wearing such
        protection still should be avoided, has led to the costume being re-imagined with varying forms of bulletproof protection which employs
        the aforementioned use of the suit's chest symbol to lure shots at the armor's strongest point. Despite the armor, Batman almost always
        evades gunfire and is very rarely actually shot. After recovering from his spinal cord injury (the result of Bane's attack), Batman
        reinforced the armor with a material to dampen shocks and impact, along with a spinal brace, to protect himself from such abuse.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="utility-belt" class="text-box v-hidden">
      <div class="text-cover"></div>
      <h5>[ UTILITY BELT ]</h5>
      <p>Although seemingly unremarkable in appearance, the utility belt remains as one of Batman's most important tools in fighting crime.</p>
      <p>At first, the belt wouldn't serve other purpose than holding Batman's trousers. However, Batman started using the belt to place
      his Batrope and soon he adapted it to hold glass pellets of choking gas, becoming the first two gadgets in the utility belt.</p>
      <p>In order to stay in contact with his new partner, Robin, Batman upgraded the belt and incorporated a radio, which was placed on
      the belt buckle of both Batman and Robin's belts. Batman also started carrying some vials on the belt with chemicals inside. Some
      of them contained a variety of gases, acids and some of them were used as explosives when mixed. Shortly after this, Batman included
      a special compartment to hold his newest gadget: the bat-tracers, which were released by pressing a microscopic switch on the belt.
      It is later revealed that the belt has a water-proof compartment where he keeps some matches. Bruce included small chemical vials and
      small tools inside the belt metal compartments.</p>

    <div id="batarang" class="text-box v-hidden">
      <div class="text-cover"></div>
      <h5>[ BATARANG ]</h5>
      <p>A batarang is a roughly bat-shaped throwing weapon used by the Gotham City vigilante Batman as a non-lethal ranged attack alternative
        to firearms, which he rejects outright due to the circumstances of his parents' murder. The name is a portmanteau of bat and boomerang,
        and were first referred to as baterangs.[1] The batarang also serves as instruments of distraction, confusion, or it is simply to
        frighten would-be adversaries that the Batman is present.</p>
      <p>Though they are named after boomerangs, batarangs have become more and more like shuriken with time. The earliest depictions were of
        scalloped, metal boomerangs which were used to attack opponents and returned to the thrower. Variations of batarangs include those
        which are able to be opened and closed (presumably so they can fit into Batman's utility belt), those which can be explosively charged
        and those which are electrified. Other varieties include remote-controlled batarangs, sonic batarangs, and even batarangs that freeze
        people or objects they come in contact with. A grappling hook made out of a batarang and a rope was common until Batman began using an
        upgraded grappling hook device.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="bat-cape" class="text-box v-hidden">
      <div class="text-cover"></div>
      <h5>[ BAT CAPE ]</h5>
      <p>As different artists have taken over the responsibility of drawing the character, the details of the suit have changed considerably.
        The original incarnation of the cape was a wing-like structure inspired by drawings by Leonardo da Vinci. This eventually evolved
        into a more cape-like design of varying length. Some artists draw the cape with protrusions on the shoulders, likely representing the
        "thumb" part of a bat's wing, though this is not a consistent addition. The cape is occasionally depicted as bulletproof.The cape
        varies according to the current writer, sometimes being depicted as bulletproof and fire resistant, and other times being nothing
        more than simple fabric that tears easily and sustains constant damage and is continuously replaced.</p>

    <div id="origin" class="text-box v-hidden">
      <div class="text-cover"></div>
      <h5>[ ORIGIN ]</h5>
      <p> A family outing to the cinema ended in tragedy for young Bruce Wayne. Walking homeward, Bruce, his father, Thomas, and mother, Martha,
        accidentally ventured into Gotham City's notorious "Crime Alley" and were accosted by a mugger. Not content merely to rob the wealthy
        family, the hoodlum - whose identity was "never determined" - shot Dr. Thomas and Martha Wayne dead before fleeing into the darkness.
        As he knelt beside his parent's bodies, Bruce swore to avenge them. After the police arrived, Bruce was comforted by Dr. Leslie THompkins.
        Dr. Thompkins and Alfred Pennyworth helped arrange matters so that Gotham's Social Services would not take Bruce into care. In this way,
        both Dr. Thompkins and Alfred enabled Bruce to realize his dream of becoming a crusader against crime.</p>
        <p>At age 14, Bruce embarked on a journey that took him to every continent as he sought to learn all the skills he would need to keep his
        vow. He studied criminology, forensics, and criminal psychology, and learned from manhunters and martial artists, mastering every fighting
        style. In time, Bruce forged himself into a living weapon to wage war on crime and injustice. On his return to Gotham, Bruce stalked street
        thugs as a plainclothes vigilante. Beaten by the very people he intended to protect, he barely survived his first night out. As he sat
        bleeding in his study at Wayne Manor Bruce knew that he had to first strike fear in the hearts of his foes. Just then, a bat crashed
        through the study window, giving Bruce the inspiration he needed.</p>

                  <p>The Joker is perhaps one of Batman's oldest and most dedicated foes. A sadistic clown bent on chaotic nihilism and
                    grinning death, despite having no obvious powers, he has presented more of a challenge to Batman over the years than
                    any number of those more powerful or well-trained than himself. He is responsible for, among other things, the murder
                    of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and the paralyzing of Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, who he made into a paraplegic.</p>

                  <p>"Two-Face" is a criminal who has one half of his face horribly scarred, and the other stunningly handsome. He's
                    completely obsessed with the number "2," duality, and fate. As such, all of the crimes that he commits revolve around
                     the number "2," and he's psychologically unable to do anything else. He carries a double-headed coin around with
                     him that has one of the heads scarred, and he flips the coin before he makes any decisions involving a question of
                     law and illegal activities; even when it would senselessly inconvenience him, sometimes surrendering when he otherwise
                     could have escaped. Tragically, before becoming Two-Face, he was "Harvey Dent," Gotham City's District Attorney, and
                     one of the Batman's closest friends and allies. Batman considers Harvey Dent's descent into madness to be one of his
                     own greatest failures.</p>

            Young Dick Grayson was born on the first day of spring. His mother nicknamed him "little Robin." Little did she know how prophetic
            this term of endearment would be in her son's life. Also, when he was up on the trapeze, he reminded his mother of a robin.
            Dick Grayson was a twelve-year-old half-Romany (gypsy) circus acrobat, the youngest of a family act called The Flying Graysons
            of The Haly Circus. Dick joined the act at a very young age, having been trained in acrobatics from birth. Before one
            appearance in Gotham City, in which The Flying Graysons were the main attraction, they were asked to pose for a photo opportunity
            with Jack Drake and his family, including their young son, Tim Drake. From that time on Tim's one and only hero in the world
            was Dick.</p>

          <h4>Robin (Damian Wayne)</h4>
          <p>Batman was not aware of Damian's existence for a considerable time. Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb,
            Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by Talia and the League of Assassins. He becomes a talented martial
            artist by the time he is a pre-teen, at which time Talia reveals Damian's existence to his father and leaves him in Batman's
            custody in an effort to disrupt his work.</p>

          <h4>Barbara Gordon</h4>
          <p>As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon has been described as one of the most popular characters to appear during the Silver Age of Comic
            Books and is also regarded as a pop culture icon due to her appearances in the Batman television series of the late 1960s and
            continued media exposure. The Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman
            franchise, including merchandise, television, and animation. During the early 1970s, the character was also used as an advocate
            for women's rights.</p>

          <h4>Superman</h4>
          <p>Kal-El was sent from Krypton by his parents before their home planet and most of its inhabitants were destroyed. He was
            found by Jonathan and Martha Kent of Smallville, Kansas when his vessel crashed in a field. They adopted the baby as their
            own, naming him Clark Joseph Kent. The yellow sun of the Solar system in the Milky Way galaxy gave Clark superpowers. He
            grew up in Smallville and moved to Metropolis to work at the Daily Planet where his relationship with many humans grew,
            especially with Lois Lane his wife to be. He always helps out those in danger as Superman and has fought many arch enemies
            with his most common enemy being Lex Luthor.</p>

          <h4>Wonder Woman</h4>
          <p>Originally, Wonder Woman owed her abilities to the goddess Aphrodite creating Amazons superior to men, with Diana being the best of their kind.
            The Golden Age Wonder Woman was later updated by Marston to be able to will a tremendous amount of brain energy into
            her muscles and limbs because of her Amazon training, endowing her with extraordinary strength and speed. According to her
            first appearance, she is stronger and more agile than a hundred of the best human athletes. In Sensation Comics #6
            (June 1942), she is able to tear a steel door off its hinges. In one of her earliest appearances, she is shown running
            easily at 80 mph. In the same comic, she jumps from a building and lands on the balls of her feet. She can even type at a
            rate of over 160 words a minute during a test given to her. It was implied, and ultimately confirmed, that any woman who
            underwent Amazon training would gain superhuman strength. The TV series took up this notion,and in the first episode of
            Super Friends, Diana states to Aquaman, "...the only thing that can surpass super strength is the power of the brain." In
            early Wonder Woman stories, Amazon training involves strengthening this ability using pure mental energy.</p>

          <h4>James Gordon</h4>
          <p>In most versions of the Batman mythos, he is at one point or another depicted as Gotham City's police commissioner.
            He succeeded Commissioner Grogan in the rank at GCPD. Gordon frequently contacts Batman for help in solving various crimes,
            particularly those committed by supervillains. Because DC Comics retconned its characters' history in the 1985 miniseries
            Crisis on Infinite Earths, and because of different interpretations in television and film, the details of Gordon's history
            vary from story to story.</p>
