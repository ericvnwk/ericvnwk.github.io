                <h5>[ ORIGIN ]</h5>
                <p> A family outing to the cinema ended in tragedy for young Bruce Wayne. Walking homeward, Bruce, his father, Thomas, and mother, Martha,
                  accidentally ventured into Gotham City's notorious "Crime Alley" and were accosted by a mugger. Not content merely to rob the wealthy
                  family, the hoodlum - whose identity was "never determined" - shot Dr. Thomas and Martha Wayne dead before fleeing into the darkness.
                  As he knelt beside his parent's bodies, Bruce swore to avenge them. After the police arrived, Bruce was comforted by Dr. Leslie THompkins.
                  Dr. Thompkins and Alfred Pennyworth helped arrange matters so that Gotham's Social Services would not take Bruce into care. In this way,
                  both Dr. Thompkins and Alfred enabled Bruce to realize his dream of becoming a crusader against crime.</p>
                  <p>At age 14, Bruce embarked on a journey that took him to every continent as he sought to learn all the skills he would need to keep his
                  vow. He studied criminology, forensics, and criminal psychology, and learned from manhunters and martial artists, mastering every fighting
                  style. In time, Bruce forged himself into a living weapon to wage war on crime and injustice. On his return to Gotham, Bruce stalked street
                  thugs as a plainclothes vigilante. Beaten by the very people he intended to protect, he barely survived his first night out. As he sat
                  bleeding in his study at Wayne Manor Bruce knew that he had to first strike fear in the hearts of his foes. Just then, a bat crashed
                  through the study window, giving Bruce the inspiration he needed.</p>

                   superhuman powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him
